# 🌐 My Interactive Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website made to present my programming skills and projects. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some open-source visual effects (like water and lightning) integrated and adapted into the layout. The site also fetches my latest GitHub repositories automatically.
